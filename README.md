# Web-Scraping
This assignment involved creating an app which scraped data from NASA sites, obtaining information on the planet Mars. The site updates information and a featured image, in real time. 

To operate, I needed to run "mongod" (without the quotes) in the terminal first. To see the changes of the site, I needed to clear the cache from Chrome each time I ran python app.py from the terminal in my python environment.
